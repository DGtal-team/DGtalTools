	- homotopicThinning3D exploits now the GenericReader class and is no more limited to vol format.
	- volFlip: tool to flip all volume slice images according a given dimension.
	- volImageMetrics: apply basic measures from two volumetric images:  RMSE and PSNR.
	- volShapeMetrics: Apply shape measures for comparing two volumetric images A and B (shape defined from thresholds): 
		* Measures from voxel partition (true/false+-, precision recall, f-measure) 
		* Measures bases on euclidean distance between the two Shape A and B.

* volumetric/volTools:
	volTools directory moved into volumetric.

* visualisation/:
	- 3dCurveViewer: A tool for visualizing the tangential cover of 3d curves.
	- 3dVolViewer: new option to limit the number of displayed voxels (can open dicom format if WITH_ITK is set to true).
	- 3dImageViewer: new tool to display slice image with interactive translatations or rotations (can open dicom format  if WITH_ITK is set to true).
	- patternTriangulation: a new tool that draws with Board2D the convex hull, the closest-point Delaunay triangulation or the farthest-point Delaunay triangulation of a pattern.
