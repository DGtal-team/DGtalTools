	- 3dVolViewer: new option to limit the number of displayed voxels.
	- 3dImageViewer: new tools to display slice image.
	- patternTriangulation: a new tool that draws with Board2D the convex hull, the closest-point Delaunay triangulation or the farthest-point Delaunay triangulation of a pattern.

	====  Release 0.6 ====

* estimators/:
	2dLocalEstimators: program to compare local curvature/tangent estimators on implicit shapes:
	 - Maximal DSS based estimators
	 - Maximal DCA based estimators
	 - Binomial convolver based estimators
	 - Integral Invariants based estimators
	3dLocalEstimators: program to compare  3D local curvature (mean or gaussian) estimators on 3D implicit shapes.


* visualisation/:
	3dCurvatureViewer: computes and displays mean or gaussian curvature of vol binary shapes.
