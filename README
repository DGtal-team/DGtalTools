Description
===========

DGtalTools project gather tools and scripts which are built against the DGtal library (http://liris.cnrs.fr/dgtal).

Please refer to the license file (LICENSE) for details on the tools license.

How to build the tools
======================

  - use cmake tool to generate a build script (MakeFile, VS project,..) from the CMakeLists.txt
  - DGtal must be installed in your system. Concerning DGtal dependencies (boost, Qt,...), all the dependencies used to compile your DGtal library must be present to build the DGtalTools  .
